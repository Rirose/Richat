# Richat

Hi there I am Rirose. A Computer Engineer Student at his third year of University.
I made this java application for a Class Project.
You can use, change, redistrubite the code as you wish. Since there is no copyright.

If you have any questions feel free to ask me. I will try to answer them.

If you have problems signing in from Google Chrome. There is a setting in Advanced Settings called "Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly" if you disable it javascript for the ajax post starts working again. I dont know the reason.

Enjoy!
